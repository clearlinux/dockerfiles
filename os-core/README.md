<!-- Required -->
## What is this image?

`clearlinux/os-core` is a Docker image with `os-core` running on top of the
[official clearlinux base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/clearlinux). 

<!-- application introduction -->
> This os-core container provides the common base layer shared by all Clear Linux* based 
> containers. It is not designed to be used stand alone, but to be pulled in via a FROM 
> entry in a new Dockerfile.

For other Clear Linux* OS
based container images, see: https://hub.docker.com/u/clearlinux

## Why use a clearlinux based image?

<!-- CL introduction -->
> [Clear Linux* OS](https://clearlinux.org/) is an open source, rolling release
> Linux distribution optimized for performance and security, from the Cloud to
> the Edge, designed for customization, and manageability.

Clear Linux* OS based container images use:
* Optimized libraries that are compiled with latest compiler versions and
  flags.
* Software packages that follow upstream source closely and update frequently.
* An aggressive security model and best practices for CVE patching.
* A multi-staged build approach to keep a reduced container image size.
* The same container syntax as the official images to make getting started
  easy.
