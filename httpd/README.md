# Clear Linux* OS `httpd` container image

<!-- Required -->
## What is this image?

`clearlinux/httpd` is a Docker image with `httpd` running on top of the
[official clearlinux base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/clearlinux). 

<!-- application introduction -->
> [Httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/httpd.html) is the Apache HyperText 
> Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program. It is designed to be run as a standalone 
> daemon process. When used like this it will create a pool of child processes or threads 
> to handle requests.

For other Clear Linux* OS
based container images, see: https://hub.docker.com/u/clearlinux

## Why use a clearlinux based image?

<!-- CL introduction -->
> [Clear Linux* OS](https://clearlinux.org/) is an open source, rolling release
> Linux distribution optimized for performance and security, from the Cloud to
> the Edge, designed for customization, and manageability.

Clear Linux* OS based container images use:
* Optimized libraries that are compiled with latest compiler versions and
  flags.
* Software packages that follow upstream source closely and update frequently.
* An aggressive security model and best practices for CVE patching.
* A multi-staged build approach to keep a reduced container image size.
* The same container syntax as the official images to make getting started
  easy.

## Deployment:

### Deploy with Docker
The easiest way to get started with this image is by simply pulling it from
Docker Hub. 

*Note: This container uses the same syntax as the [official httpd image](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd).


1. Pull the image from Docker Hub: 
    ```
    docker pull clearlinux/httpd
    ```

2. Start a container using the examples below:

    ```
    docker run --name some-httpd -dit -p 8080:80 clearlinux/httpd
    ```
    
    connecting
    
    ```
    curl http://localhost:8080/	# locally
    curl http://${server-ip}:8080/	# remotely
    ```

## Build and modify:

The Dockerfiles for all Clear Linux* OS based container images are available at
https://github.com/clearlinux/dockerfiles. These can be used to build and
modify the container images.

1. Clone the clearlinux/dockerfiles repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/clearlinux/dockerfiles.git
    ```

2. Change to the directory of the application:
    ```
    cd httpd/
    ```

3. Build the container image:
    ```
    docker build -t clearlinux/httpd .
    ```

   Refer to the Docker documentation for [default build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg).
   Additionally:
   
   - `swupd_args` - specifies arguments to pass to the Clear Linux* OS software
     manager. See the [swupd man pages](https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/blob/master/docs/swupd.1.rst#options)
     for more information.
