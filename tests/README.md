# Clear Linux micro services unit test

These are the collections of the Clear Linux micro services unit test.
The micro services are from [page](https://github.com/clearlinux/dockerfiles).

All the unit tests are writing based on BATS  [page](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats).

To run the tests, you can simple type "make tests", it will run all the test cases.
If you want to run specific micro service test, just type "make SERVICE-NAME".
For example, "make redis" to run tests for redis.
