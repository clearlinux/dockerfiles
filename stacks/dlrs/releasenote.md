# Deep Learning Reference Stack

The Deep Learning Reference Stack, an integrated, highly-performant open source stack optimized for Intel® Xeon® Scalable platforms. This open source community release is part of our effort to ensure AI developers have easy access to all of the features and functionality of the Intel platforms.  The Deep Learning Reference Stack is highly-tuned and built for cloud native environments. With this stack, we are enabling developers to quickly prototype by reducing the complexity associated with integrating multiple software components, while still giving users the flexibility to customize their solutions. This version includes additional components to provide greater flexibility and a more comprehensive take on the deep learning environment.

# The Deep Learning Reference Stack Release

To offer more flexibility, we are releasing multiple versions of the Deep Learning Reference Stack. All versions are built on top of the Clear Linux OS, which is optimized for IA.


> **Note:**
     Clear Linux will be automatically updated to the latest release version in the container. The minimum validated version of Clear Linux for this stack is 28680.

> **Note:**
> For multi-node support, we include a registry with a set of jsonnet files to show integration with Kubeflow for deployment.

## The Deep Learning Reference Stack with Intel® MKL-DNN and VNNI

The release includes:
  * Clear Linux* OS
  * TensorFlow 1.13.1 optimized using Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) primitives and AVX-512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI)
  * Jupyter Lab*

## The Deep Learning Reference Stack with Eigen

The release includes:
  * Clear Linux* OS
  * TensorFlow 1.13.1 compiled with AVX2 and AVX512 optimizations
  * Runtimes (python)

## The Deep Learning Reference Stack with Intel® MKL-DNN

The release includes:
  * Clear Linux* OS
  * Runtimes (python)
  * TensorFlow 1.13.1 optimized using Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) primitives.

> **Note:**
   When using the Deep Learning Reference Stack with Intel®  MKL-DNN version, you may see this warning message: "tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:141] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 AVX512F FMA". This is because this version of the Deep Learning Reference Stack is using Intel®  MKL-DNN for performance optimization rather than Intel®  Advanced Vector Extensions 512, and is expected for this version of the Deep Learning Reference Stack.

## The Deep Learning Reference Stack with PyTorch

The release includes:
 * Clear Linux* OS
 * Runtimes (python)
 * PyTorch with OpenBlAS
 * Jupyter Notebooks


## The Deep Learning Reference Stack with PyTorch and Intel® MKL

The release includes:
 * Clear Linux* OS
 * Runtimes (python)
 * PyTorch optimized using the Intel® Math Kernel Library
 * Jupyter Notebooks

## Licensing


The Deep Learning Reference Stack is guided by the same [Terms of Use](https://download.clearlinux.org/TermsOfUse.html) declared by the Clear Linux project. The Docker images are hosted on https://hub.docker.com and as with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc. from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).



# Working with the Deep Learning Reference Stack


The Deep Learning Reference Stack includes TensorFlow and Kubeflow support.
These software components were selected because they are most popular/widely used by developers and CSPs. Clear Linux provides optimizations across the entire OS stack for the ultimate end user performance and is customizable to meet your unique needs. TensorFlow was selected as it is the leading deep learning and machine learning framework. Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) is an open source performance library for Deep Learning (DL) applications intended for acceleration of DL frameworks on Intel® architecture. Intel® MKL-DNN includes highly vectorized and threaded building blocks to implement convolutional neural networks (CNN) with C and C++ interfaces.  Kubeflow  is a project that provides a straightforward way to deploy simple, scalable and portable Machine Learning workflows on Kubernetes. This combination of an operating system, the deep learning framework and libraries, results in a performant deep learning software stack.

Please refer to the [Deep Learning tutorial](https://clearlinux.org/documentation/clear-linux/tutorials/dlrs) for detailed instructions for running the TensorFlow and Kubeflow Benchmarks on the docker images.

## Performance tuning configurations

### Single Node Configuration

| Key | Value |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| num_inter_threads | Socket number |
| num_intra_threads | Physical cores number |
| data_format       |  NHWC for Eigen; NCHW for MKL as MKL is optimized for this format |


Example: For Intel® Xeon® Gold 6140 CPU @ 2.30GHz with 2 Sockets and 18 Cores/Socket MKL training with batch size 32:

```
  python tf_cnn_benchmarks.py --device=cpu --mkl=True --nodistortions --model=resnet50 --data_format=NCHW --batch_size=32 --num_inter_threads=2 --num_intra_threads=36 --data_dir=/imagenet-TFrecord --data_name=imagenet
```
### Multi Node Configuration
With Kubernetes + Tensorflow, a simple configuration would be: 1 master + 3 slave (master does not apply for real workloads execution) 1 parameter server + 2 worker (each deployed on a K8s slave)

| Key | Value |
|----- | ------ |
| num_inter_threads | Socket number |
| num_intra_threads | Physical cores number (Reserve 2 cores per socket for IO operations) |
| data_format | NHWC for Eigen; NCHW for MKL as MKL is optimized for this format |


Example: For Intel® Xeon® Gold 6140 CPU @ 2.30GHz based systems with 2 Sockets and 18 Cores/Socket, 2-node distributed MKL dstraining with 1 worker per node and 1 Parameter Server (PS) can be specified and launched with this [TFJob](https://github.com/clearlinux/dockerfiles/blob/master/stacks/dlrs/kubeflow/dlrs-tfjob/dlrs-bench/prototypes/dlrs-resnet50.jsonnet)
