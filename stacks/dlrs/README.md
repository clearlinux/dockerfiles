# Deep Learning Reference Stack

This provides the Deep Learning Reference Stack. To offer more flexibility, there are two versions of the Deep Learning Reference Stack: Eigen optimized for Intel Architecture and a second version that includes Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) primitives.

Please see the folders in this level about the variants and how to build/use them.
