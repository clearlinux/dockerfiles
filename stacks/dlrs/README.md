# Deep Learning Reference Stack

This provides the Deep Learning Reference Stack. To offer more flexibility, there are multiple versions of the Deep Learning Reference Stack:
* Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) primitives and AVX-512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI)  
* Eigen optimized for Intel Architecture  
* Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) primitives
* OSS PyTorch DLRS Docker image
* PyTorch DLRS Docker image w/ Intel® Math Kernel Library

Please see the folders in this level about the variants and how to build and use them.
