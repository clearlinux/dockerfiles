## Additional details on licenses

As with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may
be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along
with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being
contained). As for any pre-built image usage, it is the image user's
responsibility to ensure that any use of this image complies with any relevant
licenses for all software contained within.
