# Clear Linux* OS `r-base` container image

<!-- Required -->
## What is this image?

`clearlinux/r-base` is a Docker image with `r-base` running on top of the
[official clearlinux base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/clearlinux). 

<!-- application introduction -->
> [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

For other Clear Linux* OS
based container images, see: https://hub.docker.com/u/clearlinux

## Why use a clearlinux based image?

<!-- CL introduction -->
> [Clear Linux* OS](https://clearlinux.org/) is an open source, rolling release
> Linux distribution optimized for performance and security, from the Cloud to
> the Edge, designed for customization, and manageability.

Clear Linux* OS based container images use:
* Optimized libraries that are compiled with latest compiler versions and
  flags.
* Software packages that follow upstream source closely and update frequently.
* An aggressive security model and best practices for CVE patching.
* A multi-staged build approach to keep a reduced container image size.
* The same container syntax as the official images to make getting started
  easy.

## Deployment:

### Deploy with Docker
The easiest way to get started with this image is by simply pulling it from
Docker Hub. 

*Note: This container uses the same syntax as the [official r-base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base).


1. Pull the image from Docker Hub: 
    ```
    docker pull clearlinux/r-base
    ```

2. Start a container using the examples below:

    ```
    docker run -it clearlinux/r-base
    ```

3. Start a container and run a R script:

    ```
    docker run --rm -v $PWD:/app clearlinux/r-base Rscript /app/sample.R
    ```

## Build and modify:

The Dockerfiles for all Clear Linux* OS based container images are available at
https://github.com/clearlinux/dockerfiles. These can be used to build and
modify the container images.

1. Clone the clearlinux/dockerfiles repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/clearlinux/dockerfiles.git
    ```

2. Change to the directory of the application:
    ```
    cd r-base/
    ```

3. Build the container image:
    ```
    docker build -t clearlinux/r-base .
    ```

4. Please refer to [create custom application container image](https://docs.01.org/clearlinux/latest/guides/maintenance/container-image-modify.html) on how to customize your container image with specific debug capabilities, such as: make, git.

   Refer to the Docker documentation for [default build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg).
   Additionally:
   
   - `swupd_args` - specifies arguments to pass to the Clear Linux* OS software
     manager. See the [swupd man pages](https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/blob/master/docs/swupd.1.rst#options)
     for more information.
